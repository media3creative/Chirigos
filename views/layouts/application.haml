          %h2 "True design is about life plus style; your life, your style" 
          %p True design is about life+style; your life, your style.  My inspiration comes from the uniqueness of each client's life and their style.  I believe that the design should be an extension, unabbreviated, of the lives of everyone living in the home. And because the quality of my clientâ€™s life can drastically improve with their environment, it is my passion to create a home that is nourishing to their soul and beautiful to their eye.
          %p I encourage people to live their lives in the present.  I come across many people that hold back on designing their homes because they are afraid to make the wrong decision, or perhaps they are waiting for 'just the right time'. But life is right now, this moment! Our true gift is 'the present'.
          %p And no matter where you are in your life, no matter what your budget, there is a way to bring beauty and balance to your home. This is what excites me each time I step into a new client's home... the vision of their home being the nourishing and inspiring place they desire.

          %h1 Biography 
          %h2 "Affordable Style is not an oxymoron"
          %p Bridget's passion for home furnishings began in New York in 1990 while studying at F.I.T. and working for an up and coming fashion designer on Seventh Avenue. She was introduced by a professor to the beautiful world of home furnishings and interior design. It was an immediate fascination with how, even the smallest item in a home, can impact the way we live. She changed her major from fashion and earned a degree in Home Furnishings Product Development. 
          %p Since then her passion for creating beautiful spaces has grown stronger but with an appreciation of real people and real living. In 2009 Bridget started Chirigos Designs, a full-scale interior decorating business in Houston, TX. Being a wife, a mom, running her business at home and living with a cat, a dog and a fish, Bridget knows the demands of real living and brings a unique perspective about stylish functionality. She also understands the constraints of a budget and believes that everyone can have a fabulously designed home that they can afford.
